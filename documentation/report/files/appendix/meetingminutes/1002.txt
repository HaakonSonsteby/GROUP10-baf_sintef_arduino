Participants: Everyone present everyone except Asbjorn who have notified he would be gone.


Meeting started at 14.15

Agenda
Present how we have understood the task to the customer and get feedback on that.
Get more information about what Mr. Babak wants us to do, and how it should be done.

Additional Information
Mr. Farshchian wants us to make a couple of simple prototypes, then a big one that will show that our API support more than one social media. This will include using two different social apps the Android phone, for example Facebook and Shindig.


He also wants the API to support communication from the Arduino to Android, for example temp reading or you can push a button and poke a predefined person.

We dont have to use the Open Social java classes, but we should look into the concepts of it and do something similar.
Open Social concepts:
1.  User
2.  Group
3.  Post
4.  Stream; user stream and group stream.

Would be nice if the communication library could support other ways of communication than just Bluetooth. There should also be a way to pair the Android app with the Arduino by using MAC address.


Gui/Settings in the t-shirt app.


To do for next meeting
Think about how the WBS can be translated to stories, then to tasks for each sprint.

To do for next meeting with the customer
To do Monday:
Talk with Simone about the shopping list, find out what is already available for us.
Check out battery drain
Notes from Henrik:
Two simple prototype
one more advanced prototype


Intents library
Class intents
Stream(timeline)

Post
User                

Request Intents

Two Social apps


Look at battery drain

near field communication?

Marked integration into last years group project

Notes from Bjornar
Meeting started @ 14.15

Everyone except Asbjorn present. (notified he would be away)

Talk to the customer that we have had some problems understanding what he wants us to do, and that we want to 

make sure that we have understood him correctly before we go from this meeting.

-Johan and Emanuel explaining on the whiteboard
 -Social apps, communicate with intents with our API then to the android/arduino app, the android/arduino app 

  will communicate with bluetooth through our com-layer.
 
 -What objects that we want to use, defined from the open social standard
  -Up for discussion: how strictly we should follow the open social standard
   -Follow the overall concepts that open social is using


 -API layer will provide parsing from intents to intents.
  -The API is a part of the android/arduino app
  -Use the intent services that are already there, try to specialize the intents for our use


 -Someone who made an app store last year, check into it, can upload any files to it. Student project.
  -UBI home app
 
 -Henrik is asking about how to make requests from for example t-shirt to the social app. 
  -In the library you will have specific things you can ask about, the t-shirt can send intents, but if it    


wants to use our intents, have for example osnap.* infront of it


 -Look up how to register the app for showing up in menu when you want to share anything

-Johan explaining about the extended the t-shirt prototype
 -QR, bluetooth, supporting more than one social network
 -Extra hw devices that we have thought about, vibration, sound, display, leds
 -News feed to sound, settings page for the t-shirt app, for what should be doing what on the t-shirt
  -Disable/enable modules, what goes where.
 
 -How to go the other way?
  -Temp sensor for example, post temp to facebook.
  
 -Think about if you can make the t-shirt app in a visual editor
  -To custom make your own t-shirt, related to next phase, not priority (qued)


 -Have to think about, make a list of specifics of what we want to do.
  -The t-shirt app, would be cool with more than one thing. Make a couple of simple prototypes, and one big   


   one.
  -Point is to show that we can do more than one thing, proof it's not hard coded.


-Anders talking about the bt
 -How to connect to a specific bt device
 -Every bt have a mac adress, can be send with the QR code.


-Talk with Simone about the shopping list




-Communication library
-Documentation of the intents, how they work etc.
 -Currently have two simple apps, one sending and one recieving.
-Social intents library, t-shirt app, talk with group 11 about fall detection??
 -Two social apps, social library, communication library, android apps for prototypes, and firmware for the   


arduino, documentation for the android action intents, make available on the open source market.


-Important to be under Apache license. End user contribution agreement.


-Look into the market, we will have to get client, and how it works with QR codes etc.


-Communication library, should it be just BT, or do we have to support other wireless communications?
 -Currently it is transparent, should be possible to implement other kinds of wireless comms later.
  -Wifi would be nice, for example hotspot, so the t-shirt can be internet available.
  -Think about it, not critical
 -NFC tags at the lab, so it would be possible to test it out.
 
-Concepts
 -User
 -Post
 -Stream (news feed/wall)
 -Group activity streams
 
 -Shindig, folder with open social concepts implemented as java classes


-Some kind of management tool, to remove/update etc
 -Customer want the meeting report agenda.
