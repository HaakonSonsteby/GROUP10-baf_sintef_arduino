\subsection{Agenda}
Showcase the test applications for the jacket.

\subsection{Additional Information}

Mr. Babak liked the test application we made for the jacket, and suggested we should keep it as a generic app that can be used with all the prototypes we have made so far. This included some rework of the protocol to handle metadata that can be pulled from the Arduino unit.

Mr. Babak also suggested to make a market page for our prototype applications.


\subsection{To do}
\begin{itemize}
\item Finish up the presentation for the 16th (new date).
\item Make the app market for our prototype applications.
\end{itemize}
