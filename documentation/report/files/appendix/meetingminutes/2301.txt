Agenda


We will probably use the Java Facebook API library restFB. 
Shared some ideas. Discussed a little bit on the development process to use.
Will probably adopt Scrum as development process, given the iterative nature of our work schedule and of the meetings with customer.
Realized a proof of concept consisting in a led turned on by Arduino if there is any unread notification on Facebook.

Read the Facebook developers pages (Facebook Graph API, Access tokens..)
and Open Social documentation. It turned out Facebook does not implement the Open Social standard. restFB, a simple, flexible, actively developed and permissively licensed (MIT) Java Facebook API was found and used to code a small program that checks for unread notifications.
