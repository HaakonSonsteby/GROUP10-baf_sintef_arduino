\subsection{Agenda}

Showcasing the t-shirt app, end to end communication between facebook and android.
Licensing and how it should be applied to the project.
Talk about the progress that have been done with the APIs

\subsection{Additional Information}
Still missing HW for the project, we have ordered some private and already have one lillypad available to use.

ComLib packaged as jar file so it's easier to bundle with your app.

Regarding the APIs, we have to document what is used for the communication part. We should also make a sort of programmers manual for how to use the API.

Some time after easter we should be ready to do a presentation for SINTEF, date to be set. During this presentation it can also be viable to do a acceptance test, which would be a nice addition to the report.
