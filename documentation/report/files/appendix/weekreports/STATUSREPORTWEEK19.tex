\subsection{Progress summary}

The temperature prototype is finished. The LED prototype is finished on the software level(Android and Arduino), and the work has started on soldering the electronic equipment.
The customer really liked the way we had made a generic application to be a gateway into specific applications made for specific Arduino products. This idea was expanded and an online oSNAP market was made where applications could be found after the generic application had identified the requested applications.
The jacket is nearly completed.
