\subsection{Progress summary}
This week we needed to do a lot of re-planning because of the changes from last week. We also did work relating to how to break down tasks to a scrum environment. Further work also needed to be done relating to the Arduino protocol, and to the Bluetooth implementation for Android. We also had people researching and developing the Android social media integration part of the project and progress was done in this area.
