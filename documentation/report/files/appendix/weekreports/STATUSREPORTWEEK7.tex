\subsection{Progress summary}
This week we had discussions on which development process we should use. Xtreme Programming, spiral and others were considered but we concluded that a modified version of scrum like we previously decided on was feasible. This would also be the most reasonable choice to promote continuity with past work. Other than this we had a slow week with not much progress in regards to programming, rather we focused on process and planning work.

\subsection{Open / closed problems}
