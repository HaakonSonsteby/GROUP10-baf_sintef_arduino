PROJECT 10 Open Source Network Arduino Platform(oSNAP)




SUMMARY STATUS REPORT
Week 7




1 Introduction




2 Progress summary
This week we had discussions on which process we should use. Xtreme Programming, spiral and others were considered but we concluded that a modified version of scrum like we previously decided on was feasible. This would also be the most reasonable choice to promote continuity with past work. Other than this we had a slow week with not much progress in regards to programming, rather we focused on process and planning work.
3 Open / closed problems
Closed: Final decision on using scrum as development/process system. 




Open:
Protocol, bluetooth, social media all need refinement to fit in the scope of the project as it stands.


4 Planned work for next period
Continue work on all established work packages.
5 Updated risks analysis
