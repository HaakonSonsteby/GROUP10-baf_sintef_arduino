\subsection{Progress summary}
Further refinement of the communication library. We had some initial planning of several prototypes that would supplement the main T-Shirt idea (T-shirt was replaced by a jacket later in the project). One of them was a LED light Mood indicator fetched from Myspace. We also had more planning and research programming going into the social library, but much work remains to be done on this part.

\subsection{Planned work for next period}
Finish communication libraries
Decide on design for social library

\subsection{Updated risks analysis}
Redesigning the social library plans too much will limit progress. HIGH risk.
