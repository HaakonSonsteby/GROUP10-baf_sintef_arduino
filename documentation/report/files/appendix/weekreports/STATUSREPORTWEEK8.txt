SUMMARY STATUS REPORT
Week 8


1 Introduction


2 Progress summary
Further refinement of the communication library. We had some initial planning of several prototypes that would supplement the main T-Shirt idea. One of them was a LED light Mood indicator fetched from Myspace. We also had more planning and research programming going into the social library, but much work remains to be done on this part.

4 Planned work for next period

5 Updated risks analysis
Redesigning the social library plans too much will limit progress. HIGH risk.
