\section{Planning the architecture}

While in the planning phase of the project we first planned for making a framework that was to encompass too much of the tasks of the Android app. We also had a splitting of the framework into Arduino-to-Framework through wireless connection and another part that was to do the actual fetching of social service data. This can be found in appendix % firstdraftarchi reference.
After careful consultation with the customer we decided to revise this plan. This was not a heavy blow to the process as most of our working code was still usable in the new approach. The biggest difference in the new plan is that the framework or API on Android will communicate with external Android apps through intents, and the API will then forward this communication through Bluetooth to the Arduino. Intents will be explained in the documentation and diagrams of this chapter.
