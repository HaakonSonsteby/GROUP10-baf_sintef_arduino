\section{Problem Description}
Social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter have normally been accessed  via a web browser. Lately mobile versions have become popular, and allow access to context data such as location of users. We foresee a much bigger popularity of mobile and pervasive interfaces to social media in the coming years. 

Arduino\cite{link:arduino} is a platform that allows software to be written in order to construct hardware 
prototypes. In this task the students will develop an Arduino-based interface to Facebook. The information from 
Facebook will be made available on Arduino displays, and userâ€™s interaction with Facebook will be supported by 
Arduino sensors and actuators.

In case Facebook data access shows to be difficult, the students will use Shindig\cite{link:shinding} which 
is an open source implementation of OpenSocial APIs. The service specification is developed in the European project 
SOCIETIES in collaboration with European partners. The students are however expected to innovate and come up 
with new concepts, user interfaces, and service organization

\subsection{OpenSocial and Shinding}
Through this document the term {\em OpenSocial}\cite{link:opensocial} will be repitively used. OpenSocial is a software develepoment API that provides
one interface to multiple social networks like Twitter and LinkedIn. Note that the popular social network Facebook does not use
or support OpenSocial and uses it's own custom properitory API. OpenSocial also provides some abstract models that are common
and shared between different social networks like the concept of a Person, Friend, Group or a Newsfeed. Another thing that
made OpenSocial attractive to use in our project is that it (as it's name implies) is completely open source.

Shindig is an OpenSocial container that provides services to make development easier using developing apps for OpenSocial. There are some pitfalls
for using OpenSocial however. One of these is that it does not support Facebook. In addition it also does not provide all the services we might require
for our project (like the Wall concept or Images). Shindig seems in addition rather poorly updated and it's Java binding seems out of date and not properly
maintained by the developers.

\section{The context}
In the past few years, social networks have become more and more popular, continuously increasing their userbase.
The project task was to design and develop an open source Android framework for allowing quick and flexible
development of wireless Tangible User Interfaces (T.U.I.) for social networks using Arduino.
The product has served both as a proof-of-concept and as a starting point for future software projects.

\section{The customer}
Our customer was SINTEF, represented by Mr. Babak A. Farshchian.
Headquartered in Trondheim, Norway, SINTEF is the largest independent research organisation in Scandinavia.
Every year, SINTEF supports research and development for approximate 2,000 Norwegian and overseas
companies via its research and development activity.

\section{The Team}
The team consisted of seven students from NTNU. About half of the members have worked
together on previous projects and thus shared some teamwork skills and experiences.
Having a properly functioning team where all the skills of each team member are properly
utilized is vital for the success of any project. None of the team members had 
worked for a customer before.
