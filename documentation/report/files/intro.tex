The problem we will solve for the customer (Babak Farschian) is to make a prototype TUI (Tangible User Interface) using an Arduino product connected with Facebook or other social networks. The customer has expressed his requirements for us to generalise what we produce so it can easily be adopted as a starting point for other research projects and products. An important part of this was also to make the Arduino work with a wireless connection. This input from the customer leads us to revise our goals to primarily focus on developing a strong suite of software, so creating a working TUI prototype will be easier for ourselves and others.
