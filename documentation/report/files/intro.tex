\section{The context}
In the past few years, social networks have become more and more popular, continuously increasing their userbase.
The project task is to design and develop an open source Android framework to allow quick and flexible
development of wireless T.U.I. (Tangible User Interfaces) for social networks using Arduino.
The product will serve both as a proof-of-concept and as starting point for future software projects.
