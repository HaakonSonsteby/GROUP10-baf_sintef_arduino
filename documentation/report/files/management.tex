\section{Selecting Development Process}
The choice of a development process is crucial for every project and many factors
such as project size and scope, team members skills and time resources have to be taken into
consideration in order to make a good choice. The choice of the development process will affect
planning and many other aspects of the teamwork. The following section describes
which development processes we have considered using and the reasons behind our final choice.

\subsection{Waterfall}
The Waterfall model is a strict top-down design process. \cite{bib:waterfall}It features detailed planning, design and
documentation before design. This model is useful when going back and changing requirements is
costly or impossible. This does however require that all needed features and requirements are known
early on. The model was originally used for hardware design and when the first software projects 
appeared it was simply adapted. Many argue that the Waterfall model is bad for software design, seeing
as the developers cannot predict all problems or additional requirements before reviewing a working
prototype of the final product. Customers also often have changing requirements under development.
The Waterfall model works best for expensive projects where problem prediction and initial correct design
is vital before implementation is started.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.30]{img/designmodel-waterwall} \caption{The Waterfall model}
\label{fig:desigmodel-waterfall}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Scrum}
Scrum is an Agile software development process. The Scrum approach uses repetitive iterations (called
 Sprints in the Scrum etymology) to design, implement and refine a product. Each iteration improves,
fixes and adds new features to the previous iteration. A key feature of Scrum is that the customer
can change their mind on what they want or need. Scrum focuses on frequent group meetings and
splitting big tasks into smaller, manageble tasks for small groups of programmers. Because of the
frequent meetings it promotes verbal communication in the group.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{img/designmodel-scrum} \caption{The Scrum process}
\label{fig:desigmodel-scrum}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Extreme Programming (XP)}
Extreme Programming is a development methodology that is designed for best software quality and
quick responsivness to changing customer requirements. It is also an Agile Development method like
Scrum and therefore shares certain similarities to that development method. It promotes rapid
development and allows the customer to change his/her mind or request new features throughout
the development of the software. Typical elements for XP are pair programming, unit testing,
lazy programming, simplicity and expecting changes in customer requirements as time passes
and the problem is better understood. Several pitfalls include buggy and unstable code or lack of
overall design specification. Extreme programming is best suited for small projects for prototyping
where the customer is not entierly sure what he or she wants.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.75]{img/designmodel-xp} \caption{Extreme Programming}
\label{fig:desigmodel-xp}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Agile Unified Process}
The AUP (short for Agile Unified Process) offers a simple and easy to understand approach for software
development. It is a simplified version of the Rational Unified Process. Key features are simplicity, 
customization and focus on the task on hand instead of everything that may happen. It features
several internal development iterations before producing a customer release. AUP focuses on quality
insurance and works best for projects that is going to be used by a large public and a working, bugfree
product is important.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{img/designmodel-aup} \caption{AUP development iterations}
\label{fig:desigmodel-aupl}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Spiral Model}
The Spiral development methodology combines the advantages of both the top-down approach from 
Waterfall and the bottom-up concept of prototyping. It does this by using an iterative development
approach and by controlling it through the systematic Waterfall model. A strong advantage of the Spiral lifecycle is that it
allows new features and requests to be integrated as soon as they come avalible or known. Other key 
features of the model is risk analysis, strict system design specifications and prototyping. The Spiral model
 is best suited for large, expensive and complicated projects.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering \includegraphics[scale=0.85]{img/designmodel-spiral} \caption{The Spiral model}
\label{fig:desigmodel-spiral}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Conclusions}
We initially chosed Scrum as our development process. The reasons behind this choice were the iterative nature
of our work schedule and of our weekly meetings with the customer during which we had to present a new version
of the prototype each time. Moreover everyone in the team had some experience with Scrum from previous projects.
After a few weeks of development however, we understood that the Scrum model did not fit perfectly to our project.
This was due to the fact that especially on the 'social' part this project was much like a software research project
so the specifications and the requirements for the product were not clearly set early on, but instead unfolded little
by little during our meetings with the customer thanks to his feedback on our prototypes and documentation.
This led to some of the code and documentation that we produced to be scrapped during later iterations,
but also and especially to some delays in the overall system design. We researched then some other development
processes, namely Extreme Programming and Spiral. The Spiral model did not suit our project, it is rather meant
for larger projects with many employees. XP didn't fit us either as we needed a process that produced more documentation.
In the end we continued to use Scrum after making some changes to the process itself.

\section{Project management tools}

To help us in using Scrum we chose an online tool called ScrumDo (www.scrumdo.com).
This tool has features for most if not all parts of the Scrum process. Using this tool
consistently will be our main method of maintaining and separating packages from
the WBS (Work Breakdown Structure). In the context of ScrumDo and
Scrum these low level work packages are called stories and are moved
accordingly from \char`\"{}ToDo\char`\"{} over to \char`\"{}In progress\char`\"{}
and eventually to \char`\"{}Done'' areas.

\subsection{Software and hardware development tools}
Various software tools were used for this project.

These include:\newline
\begin{itemize}
	\item{IDE for Coding:} \newline
	NetBeans and Eclipse for Java development. SublimeText amd Arduino for embedded C development.

	\item{Collabaration tools:} \newline
	For our code repository we decided to use GIT,. GIT is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system 
	with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. Also 
	several team members had experience with GIT through other projects which was a significant factor for 
	this choice.

	We used Skype for instant message communication.

	\item{Libraries and external software:} \newline
	 Facebook Android SDK, Android SDK, RXTX

	\item{\LaTeX{} and Google Documents:} \newline
	Used for producing documentation. Google Documents for realtime documentation collaboration.

\end{itemize}

The project task requires various hardware, namely Arduino boards, shields and modules and Android mobiles.
Our customer kindly arranged for us so that we could borrow Arduino equipment from the lab. The team used its own
mobiles for running, testing and prototyping the system.

\newpage
\section{Risk analysis and mitigation strategies}

This text will highlight different realistic risks that may occur during development
that can to some degree jeopardise the process or the final product.
A table with weighted risks and relative mitigation and remedial actions follows.

\begin{itemize}

\item{Dropouts}\newline
The risk of people dropping the course or otherwise not being able to complete it as part
of the group. This can be caused by sickness as well.

\item{Arduino hardware}\newline
Our handed out Arduino equipment can fail, due to malfunctioning or wrong usage.
There is also the possibility that some of the hardware can be lost while we work with it at home.

\item{Deadlines}\newline
Throughout the course there is multiple deadlines that must be met. Failure to meet
these limits will have huge impacts on the grading and could possibly fail the group.

\item{Choosing wrong frameworks}\newline
We will necessarily have to build parts of our software around existing open source
frameworks to limit effort required by the task. If at a later point we have severe limitations
on our possibilities due to these frameworks the product could result poorer in features than
we originally planned. The impact can be negligible if other solutions are found.

\item{Design problems}\newline
It could happen that the system design is late on schedule and delays other parts of the project
including testing and documentation. Also during development features have to be constrained due to problems
or resource limitations. This could cause the final product to not satisfy the customer.
If we can find work-arounds and compromises, then the problem will not have a big impact on the process.

\item{Wireless connectivity}\newline
If the Arduino chip modules (called shields) for Bluetooth and other network interfaces were too
hard to implement we would have to reconsider wireless connectivity as an option.
We set the 'get wireless to work' deadline to be one month. If we can't get it working
by that time we will have to use cabled connections instead and that would result clumsy
for a lot of concepts.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}
	\begin{center}
		\caption{Risk Analysis}
		\rowcolors{1}{white}{lightgray}
		\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l | p{2.8cm} | p{3cm} |}
		\hline

\textbf{Description} & \textbf{Likelihood} & \textbf{Impact} & \textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Mitigation} & \textbf{Remedial Action}\\ \hline

Sickness 			& Med & Low & Med & Keep contagious sicknesses at home.
					& If the sickness is prolonged work tasks must be re-arranged appropriately. \\ \hline

Wireless Connect.	& Low & High & Med & Get it working & Switch to cable connection \\ \hline

Arduino Malfun.		& Low & Med & Low & Treat hardware properly. Do not eat or drink nearby.
					&  Get new hardware if possible.\\ \hline

Lost Hardware		& Low & Med & Low & Have control over who has what and keep an inventory list.
					& Get new hardware if possible \\ \hline

Limited Product		& Low & Med & Low & Thorough planning. Avoid late features implementation.
					&  Workaround problems at critical junctions in the process.\\ \hline

API Trouble			& Med & Med & High & Limit the scope to documented open source APIs.
					& Investigate alternative solutions. Limit impact on productivity. \\ \hline

Mid-Sem Deadline	& Low & High & Med & Produce good documentation and begin early on reports.
					&  Consult with student assistants.\\ \hline
			
Final Deadline		& Low & High & Med & Consistent work throughout the semester. Avoid last-minute feature implementation.
					&  Deliver the product in the best state possible.\\ \hline

		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}	
	\label{table:riskanalysis}
\end{table}

Concluding, most care should be put in the choice of existing frameworks and in early planning
and documentation efforts to avoid later problems related to the implementation and report delivery.

\section{Resources}
A meeting table was arranged during the first meeting. Team members
have weekly meetings on Monday, Wednesday and Friday at twelve o'clock.
Meetings with the client were arranged for each Friday at two fifteen (14:15).

The team exchanged both e-mails and mobile numbers. A permanent Skype
group chat on which we meet on a daily basis was set up, a mailing
list was also created. Several documents of interest to the group
were made available to everyone using Google Documents.
