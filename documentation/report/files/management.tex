\section{Development Process}

Given the iterative nature of our work schedule and of the meeting
with our customer, as well as his request for intermediate prototypes
to be presented during these meetings, the choice of Scrum as a development
process was natural. Moreover, everybody in the team had previous
experiences with Scrum from earlier projects. With our choice of Scrum
as process development model, Some changes to the model were adopted so
that we could follow the intended process as closely as our task and experience allow.
This changes are described in the following section of this document.


\subsection{Modifications to the development process}

To make it more suitable to our schedule we made some slight modifications
to the Scrum model. The group meetings will be held three times a week (on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday) and we will have extended work sessions on these
days too. Sprints will be modified to be primarly bi-weekly, but time
between Sprints may vary depending on the priorities identified during
the meetings with the customer and on the risk analysis. Sprint backlogs
will be very crucial in this regard. Once the goals are set,
the gradual inclusion of new features as the project evolves will
be documented in the backlogs from sprint to sprint.
A product backlog with feedback provided by the customer will also be produced.
The backlogs will be modified encompass both requirements and feature goals.
Another important difference from the normal Scrum process is that the
specifications of the prototype that will be produced will be defined
little by little in agreement with our customer during the weekly meetings.

\section{Project management tools}

To accompany us in the Scrum process we have chosen an online tool
called ScrumDo (www.scrumdo.com). This tool has features for most
if not all parts of the Scrum process. Using this tool consistently
will be our main method of maintaining and separating packages from
the WBS (Work Breakdown Structure). In the context of ScrumDo and
Scrum these low level work packages are called stories and are moved
accordingly from \char`\"{}ToDo\char`\"{} over to \char`\"{}In progress\char`\"{}
and eventually to \char`\"{}Done'' areas.

Another part of the project is the collaboration software.
Initially we decided to use Git which is a fast, scalable,
distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command
set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals.
It differs from the centralised control systems like SVN for its capability
to handle several software \char`\"{}branches\char`\"{} at once. The
branches can head in different directions and can later be merged
instead of always maintaing a central, \char`\"{}correct\char`\"{}
version. NTNU provided SVN and Trac repositories to keep track of our
project and we will use these to share finished code for evaluation
purposes. We decided to use Git due to its higher flexibility and because
of the experiences the team members already had with it.
