\section{Development Process}

Given the iterative nature of our work schedule and of the meeting
with our customer, as well as his request for intermediate prototypes
to be presented during these meetings, the choice of Scrum as a development
process was natural. Moreover, everybody in the team had previous
experiences with Scrum from earlier projects. With our choice of Scrum
as process development model, we set up some guidelines for ourselves
so that we could follow the intended process as closely as our task
and experience allow. To do we have adopted some changes in the process.


\subsection{Modifications to our project}

To make it more suitable to our schedule we made some slight modifications
to the Scrum model. The meetings will be held three times a week (on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday) and we will have work sessions on these
days too. Sprints will be modified to be primarly bi-weekly, but time
between Sprints may vary depending on the priorities identified during
the meetings with the customer and the risk analysis. Sprint backlogs
will be very crucial in this regard. With the abstract goals of the
project set forth, the gradual inclusion of new features as we and
the customer see the project evolve will be mirrored in the backlogs
from sprint to sprint. We will also maintain a product backlog with
feedback provided by the customer. To better fit our product goals
the differences between faculties of a normal product backlog and
the requirements and wishes of the customer we will have to modify
the backlog to be somewhat of an intersection between requirements
and feature goals. Another important difference to normal Scrum evolution
will have to be the “definitions of done”. As our end state is diffuse
in regards to the tangible product we have in collaboration with the
customer some design goals(see requirements) that will be the main
focus of our project.


\subsection{Project management tools}

To accompany us in the Scrum process we have chosen an online tool
called ScrumDo (www.scrumdo.com). This tool has features for most
if not all parts of the Scrum process. Using this tool consistently
	will be our main method of maintaining and separating packages from
	the WBS (Work Breakdown Structure). In the context of ScrumDo and
	Scrum these low level work packages are called stories and are moved
	accordingly from \char`\"{}ToDo\char`\"{} over to \char`\"{}In progress\char`\"{}
	and eventually to \char`\"{}Done'' areas.

	Another part of a collaborative project is the software sharing mechanisms.
	Initially we decided on using GIT, which is an open source distributed
	revision control system. This differs from the centralised control
	systems like Subversion and SVN in its complexity and its capability
	of handling several \char`\"{}branches\char`\"{} of a software. The
	branches can head in different directions and can later be merged
	instead of always maintaing a central, \char`\"{}correct\char`\"{}
	version on a server in that all involved have their own revisions
	locally, but can share to a common version(which also sits locally!).
	The faculty handed out SVN(Subversion) and TRAC to keep track of our
	software and we will use these to share finished code for evaluation
	purposes. We decided to use 'git' due to its higher flexibility and
	familiarity because of it's more flexible use and because several
	of our members had problems getting access to the Subversion servers.
