\section{Existing solutions}
The customer wanted us to find out what kind of prototype device to develop connecting a soical network and Arduino
into a tangible interface for the user. We did some research on the internet about similar and related products.  It is 
important to specify that our task was not to create another prototype, but create a  developer API that would ease 
future development of new protoypes connecting Arduino and any type of social network. The relevancy of these 
existing products for us was to confirm that it was possible to connect the user with Facebook in a tangible way using
 an Arduino. We also looked into social networks other than Facebook like Twitter or LinkedIn. Facebook is definitely the 
most popular social network out there, but it uses a proprietary API that is not compatible with the other social 
networks or open API implementations. We have included our most interesting ideas below, although we presented
many more to the customer:

\subsection{LikeLight}
The customer initially showed us the prototype of a Facebook like indicator that would glow when some content the
 user posted on Facebook was liked by someone. It was realized with an Arduino board inside a giant Lego hand. 
This prototype showed us social network connected to an Arduino, something that we ourselves were tasked to 
implement.

\subsection{YepMailbox}
The YepMailbox would be another tangiable Arduino-powered prototype that would signal whenever someone wrote
on the facebook wall of the user. The mail flag would move by a small servo motor and a printer would print out the
new message.

\subsection{Facebook Wall}
The Facebook wall would be wall with two holes in it for people to put their faces in. The prototype would then make a
picture and replace the wall with some image and add bodies to the two faces. The image would then be automatically
uploaded and posted on Facebook.

\subsection{T-shirt}
This t-shirt has integrated electronic circuits using the Arduino Lilypad technology. It should be connected wirelessly to
the internet through an Android phone to download status updates from a social network such as Facebook. This should
then be displayed through one of the electronic devices, such as LED lamps, LED screen, sound module or even a vibration
device.

\subsection{Conclusion}
Ultimately we presented our various ideas and concepts to the customer and let him decide on what he would
like the group to work on. As a prototype he would like to see a T-Shirt connected to one or more social media
that will give the user updates on any changes or updates from the social networks such as Facebook or Twitter.
This prototype would prove that our library can connect any social network (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) with any
tangible Arduino interface (LED, buzzer, sound, buttons, etc.). The customer requested one or two additional
smaller prototypes in addition to the T-shirt to prove that our API works on any prototype device and is not
specific to the T-shirt.
