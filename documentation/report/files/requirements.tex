\section{Preliminary requirements}


Wireless Connectivity

As mentioned above the customer wished for all connections to be wireless. The goal of this is for ease of access and extendability for people with limited technical knowledge. Following this approach the technical aspects of connectivity need to be abstraced so installing new features is a simple process.

Easy extendability

An important requirement for this project is for software to be open for further refinement and usage for others at a later time. With this approach we make the code foundations general so extensions may be added later and the frame work is going to be module based. Adding new functionality should be fairly easy for external developers. 

Working prototype

To show that the concept of Arduino connection with a social network works we have to make a working prototype of a TUI. Simple social network functions(likes, friend adding, text posting) should be mirrored in a tangible way through the Arduino. As we go, in consultation with our customer we will gradually decide on the specifics of our prototype that will be shown at the end of the project. This will have to be an important part of the planning stage so we donâ€™t overshoot our feature goals. Our primary focus should be to show the proof of concept in a working prototype.
