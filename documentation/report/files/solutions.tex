\section{Existing solutions}

We have done some research on the internet about similar and related products. We found an interesting
Facebook like indicator that would glow when some content the user posted on Facebook was liked by someone.
It was realized with an Arduino board inside a giant Lego hand. Another funny product is a US-mailbox rising
its 'arm'  whenever the user received a notification on Facebook. The relevancy of these existing products
for us was to confirm that it was possible to connect the user with Facebook in a tangible way using an Arduino.
Our own ideas to not have to differ much from already existing concepts, our goal is in fact to show that we can
develop a general concept that would encompass these ideas if that was the case. We also looked into social
networks other than Facebook like Twitter or LinkedIn. Facebook is definitely the most popular social network
out there, but it uses a proprietary API that is not compatible with the other social networks's or open
API implementations.

Ultimately we presented various ideas and concepts to the customer and let him decide on what he would
like the group to work on. As a prototype he would like to see a T-Shirt with a built-in small LCD screen
that will display user's data fetched from social networks, Facebook and Twitter.
