\section{Existing solutions}

We have done some investigations to other solutions found on the internet.
An interesting and very relevant product was a Facebook like indicator
that would glow when something you posted was liked. The interesting
was that this was done with an Arduino board inside a Lego hand. Another
is a mailbox rising itâ€™s arm whenever you got a notification on Facebook.
The relevancy for us is that we see it is possible to connect with
Facebook in a tangible way using the Arduino. Our own ideas to not
have to differ much from already existing concepts, our goal is to
show that we can develop a general concept that would encompass these
ideas if that was the case.
