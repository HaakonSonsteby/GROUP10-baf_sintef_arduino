This chapter describes the work done in each sprint.

\section{First sprint}

Duration: 20/01 to 02/02

The first sprint was dedicated to planning meetings and working hours
and self-study about interested technologies. The team also did a lot of
brainstorming in order to identify possible product ideas to show the
customer and produced some small proof of concept applications.
