Testing is an integral part of every development process.
Many different testing approaches have been proposed during the history of
software development, but they all suggest that testing has to be performed continuously
during the development process. This is of particular importance to our process since
it follows an iterative approach. Testing should be planned in the early stages of each
iteration for each testable unit that is going to be implemented and performed as soon as
it is complete. As the system evolves so does the testing. It should be more comprehensive
and cover each module and the system itself as a whole.

\section{Customer feedback}
Customer feedback was an important part of the testing approach for our project.
Working prototypes and/or documentation were produced for each meeting with the customer
in order to test the features implemented in the prototypes, receive a general acceptance
on our iteration goals and plan the next iteration. Receiving a constant feedback from the
user was very important as the project didn't really have a specific set of requirements from
the beginning, so acquiring feedback from the customer allowed us to understand the most common
use case scenarios and from those obtain a set of requirements used to design the system.

\section{Unit testing}
This involves testing small portions, like methods and functions, of the code, making sure they work 
as intended throughout the process of implementing code. Tests will be executed after changes in the 
code to make sure that it still works as expected, this means that unit tests have to be written for 
large portions of the API.

\section{User interface testing}
To run the prototypes we made some applications that will run on an Android phone. To make sure our 
prototypes are understandable and easy to use, we have used group members that have not been 
involved in the process of making the UI, as test candidates. It might not be the ideal way of testing 
an UI, but in the given time-frame of this project it was the easiest and fastest way of doing it.

\section{Integration testing}
After each module has been unit tested, they will be put together to form bigger components 
of the working system. This is to make sure that the smaller modules will work correctly when placed 
into bigger components. In our case this will be to run tests on the Communication and Social libraries
making sure they work individually, before they are tested together.

\section{System testing}
This involves putting the components from integration testing together to form a complete system that 
can be tested. Preferably each module will be added incrementally, to easily spot if any modules produce errors.

\section{Functional requirement testing}
Since the project is a combination of proof-of-concept and research project, tests are made
in mind to support a run of the system and are not made to check for edge
cases and more specific use.

The unit tests is made to see if we have fulfilled the functional requirements from packages F1-F7.

\section{Testing order}
Since some of the packages are connected, we need to test them in order.

Testing of hardware packages F5-F7 involves checking added components (sound, light, vibration, etc)
and confirm that they are functional. Software that is connected to hardware (F3, F4) is tested
with the relevant packages so we have shown a proof of concept.

Packages SocialLib F1 is tested together with F3 and F4 as the social protocol between the applications.
Package ComLib F2 is a part of all test that includes a wireless connection from cell phone to Arduino board.
