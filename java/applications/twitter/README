Building:
To build the Twitter social service you will need to have the following

When you're ready then:

1) Change the location of the Android SDK in local.properties to point your
Android SDK.

want to build. Keep in mind that to you will need to sign an APK built with
'ant release' in order to deploy it anywhere.
